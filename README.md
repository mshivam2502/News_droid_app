# Project Title

I have developed an Android application that provides local news and enables local users to create and share their own articles. I used Android Studio as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and Java for its ability to respond quickly in order to create the app. In addition, I utilized Firebase cloud computing services to manage the backend data.
